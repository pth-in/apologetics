## Overview

This article compiles the best Christian scholarly responses to claims that Jesus was conceived through a relationship between Mary and a Roman soldier named Pantera, or that Jesus was illegitimate.

---

## 1. Historical Source Criticism

### The Polemical Nature of the Sources

**Key Argument:** The Pantera narrative originates from adversarial sources with clear polemical intent, not historical investigation.

**Evidence:**

- **Celsus (2nd century CE):** The earliest mention comes from the pagan philosopher Celsus in his work "The True Word" (c. 177-180 CE), written specifically to attack Christianity. Celsus had no access to first-century sources and was clearly motivated to discredit Christian claims.

- **Talmudic References:** References to "Yeshu ben Pantera" in rabbinic literature appear centuries after Jesus' time (3rd-6th centuries CE) and are widely recognized by scholars as polemical responses to Christian claims rather than historical accounts.

- **The Name "Pantera" as a Pun:** Many scholars argue that "Pantera" was likely a derogatory pun on the Greek word *parthenos* (virgin), designed to mock the Christian doctrine of the virgin birth.

**Scholarly Support:**

- Peter Schäfer (*Jesus in the Talmud*) acknowledges these references are polemical, not historical.
- Johann Maier argues there are no significant historical references to Jesus in rabbinic literature.

### Early Christian Response: Origen

**Origen's Response (c. 248 CE):**

- Origen wrote a detailed refutation of Celsus in *Contra Celsum* (Against Celsus)
- He emphasized that Celsus's claims lacked any credible historical evidence
- Origen pointed out that Celsus was relying on hearsay and anti-Christian propaganda
- He argued that the Gospel accounts, written much closer to the events, were far more reliable

## 2. The Priority and Reliability of Gospel Accounts

### Early Dating and Independent Testimony

**Key Argument:** The Gospels of Matthew and Luke, written in the first century (within 60-80 years of Jesus' life), independently affirm the virgin birth, providing multiple early attestations.

**Evidence:**

- **Matthew's Gospel (c. 80-90 CE):** Contains detailed account of the virgin birth (Matthew 1:18-25)
- **Luke's Gospel (c. 80-90 CE):** Provides independent account with different details (Luke 1:26-38)
- **Independent Sources:** The differences between Matthew and Luke's accounts suggest they drew from different sources, yet both affirm the virgin conception
- **Early Acceptance:** The doctrine was widely accepted in the early church, as evidenced by:
  - Ignatius of Antioch (c. 110 CE)
  - Justin Martyr (c. 150 CE)
  - Irenaeus (c. 180 CE)
  - Tertullian (c. 200 CE)

### The Problem of the Pantera Narrative's Late Emergence

**Key Point:** The Pantera claim appears 100-200 years after the events, while the virgin birth accounts appear in sources written within living memory of the events.

**Scholarly Assessment:**

- The Gospel accounts are primary sources written during the lifetime of eyewitnesses
- The Pantera narrative is a secondary, adversarial source with no contemporary support
- Historical methodology favors earlier, primary sources over later polemical ones

## 3. The Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera Tombstone

### The Evidence Problem

**The Discovery:**

- A tombstone was discovered in Germany (Bingerbrück) belonging to "Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera"
- He was a Roman archer from Sidon who served 40 years in the first century CE

**Christian Scholarly Response:**

1. **Chronological Problems:**
   - Recent research (Christopher B. Zeichmann, 2020) has established that this Pantera was **definitely not a soldier at the time Mary would have become pregnant**
   - The soldier's career timeline doesn't align with the birth of Jesus

2. **Lack of Connection:**
   - There is no evidence whatsoever linking this specific soldier to Mary or Jesus
   - The name "Pantera" was relatively common among Roman soldiers
   - This is a case of coincidence, not evidence

3. **Geographical Issues:**
   - The soldier was stationed in Germany, far from Palestine
   - No evidence he was ever in Galilee or Judea during the relevant time period

**Scholarly Consensus:**

- Most scholars view any connection between this soldier and Jesus as purely speculative
- Even James Tabor acknowledges the speculative nature of the claim
- The tombstone proves only that a man named Pantera existed, not that he was Jesus' father

## 4. The "Son of Mary" Argument

### Mark 6:3 and Its Interpretation

**The Claim:** Mark 6:3 refers to Jesus as "the son of Mary" without mentioning Joseph, which some argue indicates illegitimacy.

**Christian Response:**

1. **Cultural Context:**
   - In Jewish culture, men were typically identified by their father's name
   - However, there are legitimate reasons why Joseph might not be mentioned:
     - Joseph may have died before Jesus' public ministry
     - The focus may be on Mary because of the unique circumstances of Jesus' birth
     - Mark may be emphasizing Jesus' human origin through Mary

2. **Alternative Explanations:**
   - The phrase could be emphasizing Jesus' connection to his mother in a context where his brothers are also mentioned
   - It doesn't necessarily imply illegitimacy
   - Other passages in Mark (e.g., Mark 1:1) identify Jesus as "the Son of God"

3. **Early Christian Understanding:**
   - The early church understood "son of Mary" in light of the virgin birth tradition
   - There's no evidence that early Christians interpreted this as indicating illegitimacy

## 5. Theological and Historical Consistency

### The Virgin Birth in Early Christian Theology

**Key Points:**

1. **Fulfillment of Prophecy:**
   - Isaiah 7:14 was understood by early Christians as predicting a virgin birth
   - The doctrine was seen as fulfilling Old Testament expectations

2. **Theological Necessity:**
   - The virgin birth was understood as necessary for:
     - Jesus' sinless nature
     - His divine origin
     - The incarnation (God becoming human)

3. **Early Widespread Acceptance:**
   - The doctrine appears in multiple early Christian writings
   - It was not a later development but part of the earliest Christian tradition
   - No early Christian sources suggest Jesus had a human biological father

### The Problem of Alternative Theories

**Why Alternative Theories Fail:**

1. **Lack of Early Evidence:**
   - No first-century sources suggest Jesus was illegitimate
   - The earliest sources (Gospels) consistently affirm the virgin birth
   - Alternative theories only appear in adversarial, later sources

2. **Theological Inconsistency:**
   - If Jesus were illegitimate, it would have been used against him by his enemies
   - Yet the Gospels show his enemies attacking him for other reasons (blasphemy, breaking Sabbath, etc.)
   - No contemporary accusations of illegitimacy are recorded

3. **The Embarrassment Factor:**
   - The virgin birth would have been embarrassing in a Jewish context
   - If it were false, early Christians would have had no reason to invent it
   - The fact that they included it despite potential problems suggests they believed it to be true

## 6. Modern Scholarly Responses

### Craig Evans

**Key Arguments:**

- Emphasizes the early dating and reliability of Gospel accounts
- Points out the polemical nature of alternative narratives
- Argues that the name "Pantera" was likely a pun on "parthenos" (virgin)

### Darrell Bock

**Key Arguments:**

- Focuses on the independent testimony of Matthew and Luke
- Emphasizes the early church's consistent acceptance of the doctrine
- Points out the lack of credible historical evidence for alternative theories

### Brandon D. Crowe

**Key Arguments (from "Was Jesus Really Born of a Virgin?"):**

- The virgin birth is a unique event, not a parallel to pagan myths
- It is supported by scriptural testimony and theological necessity
- It signifies Jesus' divine nature and mission
- The doctrine is essential for understanding the incarnation

### Mark Goodacre

**Key Arguments:**

- Emphasizes historical methodology: earlier sources are more reliable
- Points out that the Pantera narrative lacks any contemporary support
- Argues that the Gospel accounts should be given priority as primary sources

## 7. Key Arguments Summary

### Strengths of the Christian Position:

1. **Primary Sources:** The virgin birth is attested in first-century sources (Gospels)
2. **Multiple Independent Witnesses:** Matthew and Luke provide independent accounts
3. **Early Acceptance:** The doctrine was widely accepted in the early church
4. **Lack of Counter-Evidence:** No credible first-century sources contradict the virgin birth
5. **Theological Consistency:** The doctrine fits with early Christian understanding of Jesus

### Weaknesses of the Pantera/Illegitimacy Theory:

1. **Late Sources:** All evidence appears 100-200 years after the events
2. **Polemical Nature:** Sources are clearly adversarial and designed to attack Christianity
3. **Lack of Evidence:** No contemporary sources support the claim
4. **Chronological Problems:** The Pantera tombstone doesn't align with Jesus' birth timeline
5. **Speculative Nature:** Even proponents acknowledge the theory is speculative

## 8. Conclusion

The best Christian scholarly responses emphasize:

1. **Historical Priority:** The Gospel accounts are earlier, primary sources
2. **Source Criticism:** The Pantera narrative is polemical, not historical
3. **Lack of Evidence:** No credible evidence links any Pantera to Jesus
4. **Theological Significance:** The virgin birth is foundational to Christian theology
5. **Early Church Testimony:** The doctrine was consistently affirmed from the earliest times

The Pantera/illegitimacy theory remains a speculative hypothesis based on late, adversarial sources, while the virgin birth is supported by early, primary sources that were widely accepted in the early Christian community.
